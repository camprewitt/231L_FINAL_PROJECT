# 231L_FINAL_PROJECT

For this project we will create a C++ program that simulates the functionality of an ATM. All user information, including account details and balances, should be stored in a separate text file to ensure data persistence. The program should offer several options to the user, including the ability to create a new account, which will require the user's first name, last name, and a 4-digit PIN for security. Once an account is created, the user can log in by entering their correct PIN. Logged-in users should be able to deposit money into their account, withdraw money (as long as sufficient funds are available), and view their current balance. The program should validate user input, ensuring PINs are kept private and withdrawals do not exceed the available balance. 

The ATM program can use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure its functionalities into organized and reusable components. A class called Account would encapsulate private data members such as the user's first name, last name, PIN, and balance, with public methods to handle operations like creating an account, authenticating a user, depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance. File-handling for storing and retrieving account data would also be managed through methods in this class, ensuring data persistence. Another class, ATM, would serve as the interface for user interactions, containing methods to display the menu, handle user choices, and manage multiple accounts. This class would also encapsulate logic for navigating between options such as creating a new account, logging in, and performing transactions.
